# Project: termbox - a ncurses alternative

May 5th 2012, youngkevinjonas@gmail.com:
    I have completely reorganized the project
    while leaving most of the code intact (fixed
    a couple of warnings). Now you can either use
    it as a dependency for a C/C++ project by employing
    CMake, or you can install it as a Python package
    by using Python distutils and Cython.

    Fixed misuse of C prototypes (ie. foo() -> foo(void))
    Changed a couple of include paths
