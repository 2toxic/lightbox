# Project: termbox - a ncurses alternative

    Add few python2/python3 compatibility hacks.
    setup.py no longer pulls src/termboxmodule.c as a dependency

    I have completely reorganized the project
    while leaving most of the code intact (fixed
    a couple of warnings). Now you can either use
    it as a dependency for a C/C++ project by employing
    CMake, or you can install it as a Python package
    by using Python distutils and Cython.

    Fixed misuse of C prototypes (ie. foo() -> foo(void))
    Changed a couple of include paths
