!!! IMPORTANT !!!:

I've created goinstallable version of this bindings + library,
you can install it that way:

goinstall github.com/nsf/termbox-go

(only the latest Go weekly is supported at the moment)



Just run:

gomake && gomake install

It will build a module and install it to the appropriate directory.
Keep in mind that it will run 'make_libtermbox.bash' script which
uses CMake to build the termbox library itself.

To build and run an example just do this (for example using 8g/8l tools):

8g example.go
8l -o example example.8
./example
